# Deep Learning and Neural Networks Summary
 
 * The gathering of all the articles and books I've read about this. Helping me stay on point and remember the details, and hopefully it can help you understand them easier too.
 
*“Deep networks have a hierarchical structure which makes them particularly well adapted to learn the hierarchies of knowledge that seem to be useful in solving real-world problems. Put more concretely, when attacking problems such as image recognition, it helps to use a system that understands not just individual pixels, but also increasingly more complex concepts: from edges to simple geometric shapes, all the way up through complex, multi-object scenes.”*

"Neural networks" are a sad misnomer. They're neither neural nor even networks. They're chains of differentiable, parameterized geometric functions,  trained with gradient descent (with gradients obtained via the chain rule). A small set of highschool-level ideas put together
