# Machine Learning Summary
 
 * The gathering of all the articles and books I've read about this. Helping me stay on point and remember the details, and hopefully it can help you understand them easier too.
 
 Normally the steps you would take to do Machine Learning would be:
 
1. Data cleaning and formatting
2. Exploratory data analysis
2. Feature engineering and selection
2. Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
2. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model
2. Evaluate the best model on the testing set
2. Interpret the model results
2. Draw conclusions and document work
